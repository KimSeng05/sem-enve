## Research So Far...

### Resolution
Determines the number of intervals an analogue signal has to *fill*. A 0-5V signal will be mapped to 0 - (2<sup>N</sup>-1) by the ADC for a N-bit resolution.

### Prescalers

A prescaler of N implies F_ADC = F_CPU/N. In general, the ADC operates within a frequency range of 50kHz to 200kHz, which is much smaller than the clock speed of the AVR (MHz) - hence the need for a prescaler.

*Note:* The uncertainty principle applies for frequency and accuracy.

### Registers

- *ADMUX:* ADC Multiplier Selection Register
- *ADCSRA:* ADC Control and Status Register A
- *ADCL* and *ADCH:* ADC Data Registers
- *SFIOR:* Special Function IO Register
