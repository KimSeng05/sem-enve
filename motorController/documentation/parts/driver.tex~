%=== DRIVER ====================================================================
\section{Gate Driver}
The N-Channel MOSFET gate driver is selected based on the MOSFET specifications.
Additional criteria such as functionality and minimal power dissipation is
secondary.

%-----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Peak Current Drive Requirements}
This is the primary criterion for the driver selection. This is primarly based
on how fast the application (motor) requires the MOSFET to be turned on and off
(rise and fall time of the gate voltage).

This turn on/off speed, $dT$, is in turn related to how fast the gate
capacitance of the MOSFET can be charged and discharged.
        \begin{equation}
        dT = \frac{\left[ dV \times C\right]}{I} = \frac{Q}{I}
        \end{equation}

Where;
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $dV$ = Gate voltage
        \item $C$ = Gate capacitance
        \item $I$ = Peak drive current
        \item $Q$ = Total gate charge
        \end{itemize}

In the case of the IRF1405, the total gate charge is \todo{not sure,
used max total gate charge} 260nC and a turn on/off time of $t = t_r + t_f =
300ns$

Thus we have a required average current draw of
        \begin{equation}
        I = \frac{Q}{dT} = \frac{260 \times 10^{-9}}{300 \times 10^{-9}} = 0.9A
        \end{equation}

%-----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Power Dissipation}
There are three elements due to the charging and discharging of the gate
capacitance of the MOSFET
\footnote{\href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00799b.pdf}{Microchip AN799: Matching MOSFET Drivers to MOSFETs}}:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Power dissipation due to the charging and discharging of the gate
        capacitance of the MOSFET, $P_C$
        \item Power dissipation due to quiescent current draw of the MOSFET driver,
        $P_Q$
        \item Power dissipation due to cross-conduction (shoot-through) current in
        the MOSFET driver, $P_S$
        \end{enumerate}
